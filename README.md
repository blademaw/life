# Life

A game of life representation in Lobster. Mainly for understanding Lobster's
quirks so I can work with it for larger projects.

## Running

If you have the [Lobster binaries](https://aardappel.github.io/lobster/getting_started.html)
you can simply run

```bash
lobster life.lobster
```

**NOTE**: currently a WIP, and low priority.

## List of known issues & wishlist

* [x] Add support for non-square boards
* [ ] Try to optimize (look into implementing Hashlife?)
* [ ] Add UI elements with ability to:
  * [x] Change grid size on the fly
  * [ ] Add common elements (shape repertoire -- gliders, etc.)
  * [x] Clear/randomize grid
  * [x] Change some flags (e.g. debugging)
